<h1> Conclusion: </h1>

Our asignment is booking ticket. We choose it because we think that is new topic and worth to challenge, We applied new knowledge, skill that we had learned in classroom and also when we worked together. Each member had differents task to do, but we still help each others if they had problem completing their task. Our asignment maybe not perfect but we really putting our effort on it. We learned new knowledge, skill and also consolidated old knowledge, skill. especially, the most hard part is picking seat, it use alot of javascript, if that only one car to pick to seat, it not really hard, but when you choose seat, it show many car to choose seat, and each seat much have unique id and many others thing like that, that make us for 2 weeks to complete it. The most think we like when do the assignment is know many library like lomkbok and chart's library.
